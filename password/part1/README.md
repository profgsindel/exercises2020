**Cracking the Password**

>The password is a six-digit number.
>Two adjacent digits of the password are the same (like 22 in 122345).
>Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).

For example:

> 111111 meets these criteria (double 11, never decreases).
> 223450 does not meet these criteria (decreasing pair of digits 50).
> 123789 does not meet these criteria (no double).

Your social engineers have noted an additional important detail:

> The password is within the range 128392-643281.
